# February 27, 2017

Attendees: Shaun, Greg, Chris, Matt, Louise, Rodney


Parking concerns:

- Discussion about parking issues mainly concerned with Carroll St commercial district and Beltline along Wylie.  Many feel that these issues need to be addressed soon as they are only getting worse and many conflicts/confrontations are arising.
- Talked about possibility for metered parking on Carroll St and/or permitted parking on surrounding streets to cut down on displacement of residents with no off street parking
-  It was suggested that we reach out to other commercial district/neighborhood areas to see how they've dealt with parking issues (Inman park, L5P, Virginia Highlands)
-  Shaun will reach out to either John Dirga to get the Inman Park NPU rep's contact information or directly to the IP transportation chair to discuss lessons learned from their implementation of permitted parking on select streets


Neighborhood workshop:

- TSW and Urban Trans have both given bids to do work on workshop/transportation plan (see google drive for both bids)
- Survey was drafted to get at main concerns/interests of residents (also on google drive if anyone wants to submit comments)
- It was discussed that we should reach out to both TSW and Urban Trans to get their input on questions that we should ask and wording since the data that is generated will be used by them to conduct workshop and identify priorities for the plan.  Shaun will reach out to both firms about adding questions
- Once questions are confirmed survey will be created in Survey Monkey
- Discussed needing multiple methods for reaching out to residents.  It was discussed that survey would be posted to cabbagetown and reynoldstown FB pages, Nextdoor, and paper copies would potentially be delivered to homes as well (Rodney volunteered to help distribute)
- Timeline for workshop is projected for April/May
- Greg brought up that truck access for Stein Steel and Colgate is something to consider with the workshop consultants

Proposed standing meeting time for 4th Tuesday of every month.  Please let the group know if there are any conflicts.
