### Cabbagetown Commercial District/Carroll Street Business District


* permitting parking requirements
  * 70% neighbors must approve
  * then study and a formula
  * considerations
    * Cabbagetown - most sense
      * limited offstreet parking
      * building restrictions to creating additional offstreet
    * Beltline visitors
* Carroll St parking/access ideas
  * eliminating parking?
    * existing width would increase speed
    * widen sidewalk (on East side)
    * current configuration is awkward but creates a very safe, pleasant pedestrian environment
  * metered parking
  * opportunity to work with Stacks to provide additional neighborhood parking
    * beyond current employee parking arrangement
    * who pays for it? probably charge?
    * public parking off Carroll St/access via Boulevard?
    * would prefer business/homes facing Carroll St (area that's currently a fendced off parking lot)
    * opportunity to build structured parking? (expensive, encourages more cars, not fewer)
* wayfinding: signage to advertise Cabbagetown business district
  * neighborhood branding/navigation/discoverability
    * signs like "0.3mi to Cabbagetown Business District"
  * location opportunities
    * along Beltline (target: peds/cyclists)
    * near Memorial Drive developments
    * Krog Tunnel
    * Bouelvard
  * example
    * EAV sign on Moreland
    * Kirkwood neighborhood organization doing this now
  * process
    * not allowed to advertise private businesses in public right-of-way
    * define Carroll St Commercial District, Historic Cabbagetown Retail District
    * neighborhood can pay for it, otherwise city will give standard signage, Urban Design Commission may not approve
    * opportunity to take existing signs, make bigger/visible
    * opportunity: Estoria 97 could install a sign
    * would have to work with Urban Design Commission RE: historic district
    * privately funded efforts
    * working with firms to identify locations, design; but expensive
  * business district collaboration
    * opportunity for leadership
    * messaging the mutual benefit
    * longterm vision; battling tendency to focus on short term/individual interests
    * partner with Stacks, significant contributor to the vibe of the area
    * opportunity with the wayfinding/neighborhood signage
    * CNIA collaboration/involvement


### Imagine Memorial Drive


* GDOT pursuing crosswalk in Cabbagetown; likely near Berean & Memorial
* resurfacing/restriping Memorial from Pearl due East (focus: reversible lane) 4 miles, center turn lane
  * neighborhood engagement, primarily Reynoldstown, with Cabbagetown involvement
  * next summer
  * strategy for informing the neighborhood, hosting neighborhood meeting that GDOT attends
  * funding FY19 (July 1st, 2018); likely July/August 2018 execution


### Dekalb Ave. complete street


* Complete Streets initiative
* contention around reversible lane
  * Mike Torpy, other vocal opponents
  * opportunity: letter of support from the neighborhoods
* primarily dealing with City of Atlanta for Dekalb Avenue (unlike Memorial with GDOT)
  * city politically gunshy
  * GDOT: reversible lanes are unsafe, not efficient (benefit eliminated due to left turning)
* plan for Dekalb Avenue
  * timing for the project
  * neighborhood preference (consensus will be a challenge)
  * communicate opportunities
    * fixing bottleneck at Krog Tunnel
    * safe crossing of Dekalb on foot/by bicycle
      * already coming via pedestrian scramble
    * safety issues of reversible lane
  * Shaun is drafting an article to define Complete Street in context of Krog
    * safety
    * multi-modal transportation
    * sidewalks & walkability/connectivity
  * present to neighborhood next month
    * advertise conversation/opportunities here
      * likely need a series of meetings
    * eventually, once neighborhood has clear support of a direction, draft letter of support
* ideas
  * eliminate left turns at intersection of Krog & Dekalb
  * "official public comment period is over" but it's also important to build community support (it can still fail without it)
* find examples around the city/country of improvements
  * turn lanes introduced on Randolph at Highland


### Wylie St. speed table


* Adam has been in communication, follow up with him
* they may be changing this to a speed table
* send Beltline letters requesting speed table/communicating expectations/need


### neighborhood communications/resources


* site resources
  * blog for updates
  * meeting minutes
  * workshop plan findings/results
