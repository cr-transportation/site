## 2017 Transportation Plan update

The *2017 Cabbagetown/Reynoldstown Transportation Study* final draft has been published to the site for your review:
[https://cr-transportation.github.io/site/plan/](https://cr-transportation.github.io/site/plan/)

We're sharing with the neighborhoods and city officials for feedback.

## Agenda

> In the spirit of taking an active approach to solving transportation issues, we'll have a "mobile meeting".
>
> We'll meet at the community center (usual place) and, weather permitting, take a walk down Wylie and possibly some other streets (depending on how active the group is feeling) to look at and discuss some of the areas of interest in the report. This would be a good meeting to share around and try to get new faces to join.

## Observations

* lighting needed in Krog tunnel travel lanes for cyclist visibility, safety
* cyclist transition at Wylie/Krog (both directions) hazardous
* Krog tunnel Dekalb Ave intersection bike box
* Ped crossings along Wylie (near Milltown Lofts) hazardous (speeds, visibility), opportunity: in-street crossing sign (like at the capitol; see [this resource][in-street-crossing-sign])
* Vehicular speed along Wylie hazardous; opportunity: Speed cushions (see the [NACTO guide][speed-cushions])
* Alcove park activation (yard games, benches, tables, etc)
* Beltline Wylie crossing (by Stein/Hulsey) transit RoW interim activation (food truck, benches, picnic tables)
* Relay bike hub locations (where do we need hubs in our neighborhood?)
* re-striping on Wylie; not handled by ABI, city/Natalyn; resurfacing (downside: potential for increased vehicular speed)
* Truck access plan needed for Stein Steel, Colgate; map with routes, neighborhood resolution

## Resources

A new study published by the NTSB: *Reducing Speeding-Related Crashes Involving Passenger Vehicles*. Relevant linkts:
