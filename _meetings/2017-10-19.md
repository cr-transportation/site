# October 19, 2017 CRTC

## Agenda

* Berean Ave safety improvements, tactical urbanism experiments
* MARTA direct ADA access
* Community concerns

## Notes

### Berean Ave safety improvements, tactical urbanism experiments

* concerns: speeding straight, flat, wide
* opportunity: test out ways to slow traffic (tactical, short term implementations)
* possibilities
  * Parking on alternating sides (creating a chicane)
    * concern: enforcement needs to be on board
  * Two-way bike traffic; painting bike lanes (visually narrows the corridor)
  * bulb outs with seasonal themes (hay bales, pumpkins, LEDs)
* objectives
  * Test for outcomes (improved safety from reduction of vehicular speed)
  * Neighbor involvement (support testing, provide feedback on implementation/improvements)
* Variety of materials to consider
  * Spray chalk, could last weeks to months (depending on weather, wear-and-tear)
  * Benches to create obstacles (need additional protection)
  * green **slow**, *children playing* warnings
  * barriers (plungers, roll glue, pool noodle)
* Concerns
  * support from neighbors (safety concerns, willingness to experiment)
  * Maintenance
  * City cooperation
* opportunity to involve local students
  * tactical urbanism class
  * 3D printing bulb outs, LIDAR for measuring speeds
  * Needs help with community engagement
* related opportunities/experiments
  * Gaskill contra flow bike lane (access, safety)

### Parking strategy & policy

* Permitting is a long process
  * Favorable in Cabbagetown
  * Precedent in Inman Park
  * Reynoldstown generally less need
    * needed closer to big developments, along Beltline, near Memorial, on narrow streets with historic buildings (no off-street parking)
  * can add permitting/metering street-by-street
* several options for implementation
  * permit-only during restricted hours (typically 8pm-8am)
  * example: https://www.sfmta.com/services/permits-citations/parking-permits/residential-area-permits/program-background
* opportunity: **Parking Benefits District** (*PBD*)
  * Paid parking (permits, metered, ticketing)
  * money goes back into neighborhood
  * funds community improvements, signage, et al
  * challenge: not currently implemented anywhere in Atlanta
* existing study for permitted parking in North Grant Park (Jeshua?)
* questions & concerns:
  * parking enforcement? (likely new agency, ATL Plus)
  * affect on businesses? (higher turnover)
  * which streets?
  * payment (meters, permits, tickets)?
  * permitting process?
* Community support needed: address to CNIA/RCIL, help navigate where to start with a *PBD*
* *PBD* could apply to C-town, T-town, Grant Park, R-town collectively (near Memorial)

### MARTA Direct ADA Access

* need: direct ADA access from Walthall to Inman Park/Reynoldstown South MARTA Rail Station
* opportunity to be a major project for us to pursue
* Stair removal? **No**
* Location has possibility for TOD development on South parking lot (not anytime soon)
* MARTA may be open to considering this access again
* community task: walking, documenting current compliant route; condition of sidewalks?
* recently approved MARTA tax includes station enhancements, potential funding source
* require a concerted neighborhood effort to raise awareness & support
* Letter drafted within committee, floated to neighborhood groups
* Get neighbors to come out to the meeting, the
* relevant concerns
  * lighting
  * sidewalks
  * potholes
* community complaint: cigarette smoking at MARTA station bus stops

### Community concerns

* Tree protruding into roadway on Boulevard at road curve
  * safety/visibility concern
  * Tree paved around, curb
  * when driving around corner, little time to react resulting in swerving
  * opportunity to add hi-viz elements (reflectors) to tree? on private property
  * vehicles driving over roots, tree will die eventually
* street parking issues on Boulevard & Weatherby
  * issues with limited visitor parking from MoDa, cars blocking street access
  * out-of-town guests, parked car on street poorly, cut off access, for two weeks
  * social issue: residents need to be respectful of neighbors and limited parking/access, instruct guests on how to park on street, ensure residents can move guest cars if parking arises
  * how to identify who owns a vehicle to get in contact for issues like this?
    * permitted parking could help?
* Speed bumps
  * other options: speed tables,
  * city preferring other options to control speed like: narrower lanes, chicanes
  * city council has refused previous requests over the past few years
* Speed table at Kirkwood & Beltline
  * concerns with speed table not being implemented currently, if ever
  * reportedly city says 20ft street width required for speed table, Kirkwood is 15ft (not eligible)
  * consensus: Beltline should have RoW at Kirkwood
  * Previously communicated: speed table @ Kirkwood crossing slated towards end of Phase 2 (Kirkwood to Memorial segment)
  * Lisa Safstrom spoke with Katherine at Beltline RE: lacking speed table, may have more insight
  * Follow up with Beltline needed
  * Invite Beltline to participate in the committee
* Sidewalks
  * Chester
  * TODO: collect more data on issues/needs

## Next steps

- [ ] Plan next CRTC meeting
  * meet at Park Grounds
  * walk to current direct access point on Walthall
  * walk the current direct ADA access route
  * encourage community attendance to show support
  * share Letter of Support draft with attendees (feedback, support, concerns)
  - [ ] @ian handouts for meeting, working with Becky Katz on relevant projects
  - [ ] related: document current state of ADA access
- [ ] Draft Letter of Support for MARTA direct ADA access @mtodd
  * objective: secure support from neighborhoods
- [ ] reach out to Berean neighbors with visuals
  * messaging: to address safety (speed) concerns, would like to pursue tactical urbanism project
  * flyer for community engagement @shawn
  * opportunity for student involvement
- [ ] Speed bumps
  * Contact Natalyn's office about speed bumps
  * Identify specific streets/routes with greatest need/suitability
- [ ] investigate reflective materials for tree protruding into roadway on Boulevard & Weatherby
  * ABC may have materials
- [ ] Write paragraph for Ctown newspaper
- [ ] bring up Parking policy (**Parking Benefits District**) to CNIA for guidance @shawn
- [ ] Follow up with Beltline RE: speed table at Kirkwood & Wylie crossings
- [ ] Invite Beltline org to participate in the committee meetings

## Agenda items for future meetings
