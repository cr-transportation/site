## 2018 Goals

### Projects Underway

* Reynoldstown MARTA Rail Station ADA-compliant access ramp
  * goal: public commitment from MARTA for 2018
  * potential funding in form of *MARTA Referendum*, station enhancements
  * Bike 2.0 plan that designed the ramp (no money attached, currently)
  * identify who is making these decisions
* Support DeKalb Ave Complete Streets
  * see _Streets Alive Dekalb Ave_
* Improve Wylie St. Beltline Crossing (Speed Table)
  * resurfacing Wylie soon
  * concern: would need to shave down the road to create more of a grade change between road and existing sidewalk/crossing (which might not be redone)
  * talk to Beltline
* Berean speeding fix
  * contraflow bike lane
  * takeaways:
    * paint is not going to slow down cars
    * average is low (periods measured were limited, excluded morning/evening rush hours)
    * risk is with the outliers
    * needs physical impediments (chicanes, physical barriers, etc)
    * city won't prioritize low-volume residential street
    * put in real infrastructure
  * opportunity: apply for city grant program

### Potential projects

* Cabbagetown Parking Pilot Program
  * pilot program on/around Carol St
  * goal: implemented/operating end-of-year 2018
  * identify quarterly goals
  * initial meeting with Yeshua, Shaun, Greg, maybe Katie
  * subcommittee/task force
* Partner with Streets Alive
  * engage with the community
  * idea: "Rally @ 3pm", set time/location for committee to meet up
* Beltline Community Liaison
  * who: a resident in the neighborhood
  * goal: consolidate feedback from community, interface with Beltline, champion projects like speed table
  * potential focus areas: development, housing, trail
* Boulevard tunnel project
  * relevant: Renew Atlanta Boulevard project
  * check on status
* Sidewalk/crosswalk audit & repairs
  * relevant: Edgewood's sidewalk audit
    * developed grading/scoring system (non-existent, non-compliant, needs improvement, ADA compliant)
    * gathered 10 ppl on a Saturday, including someone with disabilities
    * assessed/graded against the system all sidewalks
  * Reynoldstown
  * information will help us prioritize which streets are the most in need
  * example: Walthall, from MARTA Rail to Memorial (via Flat Shoals)
  * goal: audit/assess current conditions
  * enable neighbors to go to city councilmembers (via Natalyn Archibong)
    * e.g. "we need money to fix 1 mile of sidewalk"
* Relay Bikeshare hub @shaunhoulihan
  * identifying locations for new hubs
  * think about where it goes: location requirements tricky; solar power needs
  * bike corral on Carol could be upped to a virtual hub
  * reach out to Becky Katz RE: Relay hubs
  * existing hubs
    * Doc Chey's
    * ABC virtual hub (on Wylie)
  * eventually
    * Carol Street coral

      * Memorial @ East Side Trail; too early for now
